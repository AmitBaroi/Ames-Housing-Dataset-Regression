# Predicting House Prices using the Ames Housing Dataset

In this analysis we explore the [Ames housing dataset](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/AmesHousing.xls) by [Dean De Cock (2011)](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf), train machine learning algorithms and try to predict house prices using various regression models. We test several different models, conduct bias variance analysis and k-fold cross validation to select the best regression model for this particular dataset.

**Repository structure:**

- `Ames Housing Dataset Regression Project.ipynb`: a Jupyter Notebook detailing the data analysis process for predicting house prices.
- `data`: a folder containing the Ames Housing Dataset and associated files.
  - `AmesHousing.xls`: the Ames Housing dataset excel file as collected from the source.
  - `DataDocumentation.md`: descriptions about each of the columns and their unique values.
  - `source.txt`: reference to the dataset and data documentation files.

This analysis was done as part of the Final Project for my Introduction to Data Science course at Dalhousie University.
